This project aims to create an engaging online platform for the classic Pong contest. Our goal is to provide users with an enjoyable experience, allowing them to participate in competitive matches against others. To achieve this, we've carefully choosed several project key modules to enhance the platform's functionality and user experience.
Firstly, the Web module serves as the foundation of our platform, utilizing Django for backend development, Bootstrap for frontend design, and PostgreSQL for data management.
User Management ensures smooth user interactions, including registration, authentication, profile customization, and match histories. Additionally, we've implemented remote authentication for added security.
Gameplay and user experience are prioritized with features such as remote player functionality, alternative game options with matchmaking and user history tracking, and a live chat feature.
Our AI-Algo feature introduces challenging AI opponents without relying on complex algorithms, ensuring fair and engaging gameplay.
Cybersecurity measures include WAF/ModSecurity implementation, HashiCorp Vault for secure secrets management, GDPR compliance, and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
In the DevOps realm, we focus on establishing a reliable infrastructure with ELK for log management, Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring, and a microservices architecture for scalability.
The Graphics module enhances visual elements using advanced 3D techniques, elevating the overall gaming experience.
Finally, the Server-Side Pong feature introduces server-side gameplay and an API for seamless integration, providing continuous entertainment for users.
